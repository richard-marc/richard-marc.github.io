        <h3>3. Data and Ownership</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for the commands you issue to the Bot. All data generated by your interaction with the bot, such as your inventory and balance, is stored to provide the Bot's features. While we strive to maintain data integrity, we are not liable for any loss of data. All virtual items (e.g., currency, fish) have no real-world value.</p>

        <h3>4. Disclaimers</h3>
        <p>The Bot is provided "as is," without any warranties. We do not guarantee that the Bot will be available 24/7, be free of bugs, or meet your specific expectations. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Bot at any time, for any reason, without notice.</p>

        <h3>5. Changes to Terms</h3>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes. Your continued use of the Bot after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

            <li><strong>Game Data:</strong> This includes your in-game balance, your inventory of fish and items, your fishing rod details, and your fish collection progress. This data is necessary to save your game state.</li>
            <li><strong>Server Data:</strong> The bot may store server-specific configurations if server administrators customize it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How We Use Your Data</h3>
        <p>Your data is used exclusively to provide and improve the Bot's services:</p>

            <li>To operate leaderboards and other competitive features.</li>
            <li>To identify you in our system for support or data-related requests.</li>
            <li>To ensure the security and integrity of the service (e.g., to prevent exploits).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your data with any third parties.</p>

        <h3>3. Data Storage and Security</h3>
        <p>Your data is stored on a secure, private server. We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or loss. Data for each user is stored in a separate file, linked only by your User ID.</p>



        <h3>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
        <p>We store your data as long as the Bot is in a server you are in, or until you request its deletion. If you wish to have your data removed from our systems, you can contact the bot developer. Upon request, we will permanently delete all data associated with your User ID.</p>

        <h3>5. Your Rights</h3>
